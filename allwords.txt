necessarily
a

behold

feel
fully
satisfied
that
the

like
that
the
robin
europe
assumed
during
the
first
autumn
and
that
never
again
thrown
off
but
might
expected
much
more
brilliant
and
sparkling
during
the
breeding
season
than
any
other

have
remarked

a
slight
difference
exists

difference

too
trivial
regarded
otherwise
than
indicative

mere
variety

these

the
